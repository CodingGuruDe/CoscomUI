            Modern browsers such as Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari are tested on the latest 10 versions. IE is not supported. No strict tests are being implemented on other versions due to the constraint of development resources, but coscom-ui is
            expected to work on those browsers whose version is not too old (eg. in 2 years). If you find any problems please feel free to create an issue.
